# Overview
Just a place for all my dotfiles and configs for neovim, vsh etc. Feel free to give it a try on your setup if you'd like.

Inspiration from Mike Hartington https://github.com/mhartington/dotfiles

# Installation
Run the `install.sh` script, sit back and relax.

I use Iterm nightly for the true colour support. Go to preferences -> profiles -> colours and import `oceanic-next` from the `config` folder as well as the `source code pro` font package.

After doing all of that, your terminal should look like mine.
