# Dotfiles and Such
If you're looking for my setup you're in the right place.

# Installation
Clone this repository and simply run the `install.sh` script. The rest is taken care of for you.

# Making Changes
The dotfiles are managed via RCM. If you want to make changes to any dotfile, check if it is managed by RCM 
with `lsrc`. If the file you're looking to change is on the list, simply navigate back to this repository,
make the changes you want, and run `rcup`.

# Uninstalling
If my dotfiles aren't your thing (acceptable really), run `rcdn` and delete the `.dotfiles` link in the 
$HOME directory.
