# Wishlist
A list of things I want for Christmas.

## Git
 - Signed git commits: _single key for my two dev platforms Mac and Linux_
 - Include DNN weigth files in global git ignore: _Need a good system beyond just banning HDF5 files_

## FISH
 - Port the Bash extract function I had in `aliases` to FISH
